# Welcome to Find My Hat

A 16-bit style game created with React.

"Find My Hat" is a game where the objective is to locate a hat without falling into traps. The scenario is generated automatically and randomly at each start, providing a unique experience with every playthrough. Originally conceived as part of a JavaScript and Node.js study in the Codecademy Front-End Developer course, the project evolved and was implemented in React so that it could be played directly in the browser.

## Occasionally, it may create an impossible path to reach the hat.

This is something I am working on.
